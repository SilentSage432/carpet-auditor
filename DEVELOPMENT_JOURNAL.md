## 2026-07-25 — Initial standalone auditor

### What shipped
- Next.js App Router + Tailwind CSS v4 mobile-first carpet roll auditor.
- Core formula: `CLF = measurement_inches × rounds × 0.2625`.

- Location segmented control: Sales Floor / Top Stock.
- Supabase `carpet_audits` persistence via `@supabase/supabase-js`.

### Ownership

- Anon RLS policies in schema are permissive for a floor tool; tighten before multi-store production.
